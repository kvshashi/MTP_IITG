*ANN_Encoder_Decoder*
1.It is a simple implementation of ANN.
2.We read the input from our top_set(topology setting array) with CNN and then compress them to lower dimensions 
  and then revert them back to orginal dimension.
3.We compare the reverted image with the image we have from topology optimization and then backpropgate with our loss function as 
  binary-cross entropy(just for now).
4.Then we predict with our model for x_test which is the splitted inputs from top_set.

*Variational_AutoEncoder*
1.Problem is to that we are not able to utilize our topology setting.
2.Try Modifying the loss function , we have to give input as our topology_setting , we compress it to lower dimension(latent space in
  this case), we then sample parameters from latent space , expand them back to their original dimension as of input , compare the loss
  between topology optimized image for that particular setting with the output we receive from the decoder , then propogate the error back 
  and update.
